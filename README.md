# üìö Data Structures

A clean and educational Java project implementing core data structures from scratch. This repository helps reinforce the internal working of data structures without relying on built-in Java utilities.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Array

A **custom dynamic array** implementation that resizes automatically when capacity is exceeded. Provides constant-time access by index.

**Key Features:**
- Add, remove, and access elements
- Automatic resizing (growth logic)
- Time complexity:
    - Access: O(1)
    - Insertion (end): O(1) amortized
    - Deletion: O(n)

---

### 2. Linked List (Singly)

A **singly linked list** where each node points to the next. Great for dynamic data with frequent insertions/deletions.

**Key Features:**
- Add/delete at head or tail
- Search by value
- Iteration support
- Time complexity:
    - Insertion: O(1) (at head), O(n) (at tail)
    - Deletion/Search: O(n)

---

### 7. Doubly Linked List

An enhanced version of the linked list where each node has both `next` and `prev` pointers, allowing traversal in both directions.

**Key Features:**
- Insert/delete at head, tail, or specific index
- Traverse forward or backward
- More efficient deletions than singly linked list when node reference is known
- Time complexity:
    - Insertion: O(1) at ends, O(n) at index
    - Deletion: O(1) with node reference, O(n) by value

---

### 3. Stack (Linked List-based)

A **stack implemented using a singly linked list**. Follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)**.

**Key Features:**
- `push()` to add element to top
- `pop()` to remove element from top
- `peek()` to view the top element
- Time complexity: O(1) for push/pop/peek

---

### 4. Stack (Array-based)

A **stack backed by a dynamic array**.

**Key Features:**
- Similar operations to LinkedList stack
- Dynamic resizing
- Time complexity:
    - Push: O(1) amortized
    - Pop/Peek: O(1)

---

### 5. Queue (Linked List-based)

A **FIFO (First In First Out)** queue implemented using a linked list.

**Key Features:**
- `enqueue()` to add at rear
- `dequeue()` to remove from front
- Time complexity: O(1) for enqueue/dequeue

---

### 6. Dictionary (Key-Value Store)

A **simple dictionary** (like a basic HashMap) to store key-value pairs.

- A simple array of linked lists (chaining)
- A linear probing array
- Or just a list of key-value entries

**Key Features:**
- `put(key, value)` to insert/update
- `get(key)` to retrieve a value
- `remove(key)` to delete a key
- Time complexity (ideal case): O(1)
